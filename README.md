This repository provides the official implementation for our paper, "Rethinking Class Imbalanced Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation". We propose the Duo-component Modulation Network (DuoMod-Net) , a synergistic learning framework designed to tackle the dual challenges of class imbalance and sparse features in semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation. We demonstrate its effectiveness on challenging public benchmarks, including AMOS , WORD , and FLARE22.
